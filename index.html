            <p> Solving the rubik's is not as easy as it seems. There are many algorithims and methods to make all 6 sides the same colors.It takes practice and focus. Once you learn the basics it is just muscle memory. People most commonly the main cube as a 3x3 but there are many more. Such as the pyramix, 2x2, 4x4,5x5, and so on. Rubiks cube can sharpen your brain and that is what makes them so fun. I reccomend that you try to solve a rubiks cube to.</p>
